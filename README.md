# Statistics Calculator Program

## Overview
This program is a comprehensive tool for calculating basic statistical measures from a given dataset. It is developed in C++ and provides functionalities to compute mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation of a series of numbers. The program is user-friendly and guides the user through the process of entering data and viewing the results.

## Features
- **Data Entry**: Accepts a dataset from the user.
- **Mean Calculation**: Computes the average value of the dataset.
- **Median Calculation**: Determines the middle value in the sorted dataset.
- **Mode Calculation**: Identifies the most frequently occurring number(s) in the dataset.
- **Variance Calculation**: Calculates the measure of dispersion within the dataset.
- **Standard Deviation Calculation**: Computes the standard deviation, providing insights into the data spread.
- **Result Display**: Outputs the calculated statistics both on the console and in a file named "output.txt".
- **Repeat Functionality**: Allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

## How to Use
1. **Compile the Program**: Use a C++ compiler to compile the provided `.hpp` and `.cpp` files.
2. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program.
3. **Enter Dataset Size**: Input the number of elements in your dataset when prompted.
4. **Input Data Elements**: Enter each element of your dataset as prompted.
5. **View Results**: Observe the calculated statistics displayed on the console and saved in "output.txt".
6. **Repeat or Exit**: Choose to perform another calculation or exit the program.

## Installation
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. Download the `statistics_calculator.hpp` and associated `.cpp` files, then compile them in your development environment.

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler
- Basic understanding of terminal/command prompt usage
